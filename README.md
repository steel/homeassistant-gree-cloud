## Known Limitations

- **Cloud polling**: The integration polls the cloud every 60 seconds for state updates. Local changes may take up to a minute to reflect in Home Assistant.
- **Internet required**: Devices must be connected to the internet and the Gree Cloud for this integration to work.
- **No local control**: This integration does not support local UDP communication. For local-only devices, use the official Gree integration.

## Troubleshooting

### Login Failed

- Verify your Gree+ credentials are correct
- Ensure you selected the correct server region
- Check that your account has devices registered in the Gree+ app

### Devices Not Discovered

- Ensure devices are online in the Gree+ app
- Try reloading the integration
- Check Home Assistant logs for error messages

### Commands Not Working

- Check if device is online in Gree+ app
- Verify internet connectivity
- Look for timeout errors in logs
- Try reloading the integration

### State Updates Delayed

- This is normal - cloud polling occurs every 60 seconds
- For immediate feedback, check the Gree+ app
- Consider using local integration for local devices

### Enable Debug Logging

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.gree_cloud: debug
    greeclimate: debug
```

## FAQ

### Q: What's the difference between this and the official Gree integration?

**A:** The official integration only works with devices that support local UDP communication. This cloud integration works with **cloud-only devices** that can only be controlled via the Gree Cloud MQTT broker. If your device works with the official integration, use that instead for better responsiveness.

### Q: Can I use both integrations at the same time?

**A:** Yes! You can use both integrations simultaneously. Use the official integration for local devices and this cloud integration for cloud-only devices.

### Q: How often does the integration update device state?

**A:** The integration polls the cloud every 60 seconds. Changes made in the Gree+ app or locally on the device will be reflected in Home Assistant within 1 minute.

### Q: Does this work offline?

**A:** No, this integration requires an active internet connection to communicate with the Gree Cloud servers.

### Q: Which cipher version should I use?

**A:** Currently, the integration defaults to CipherV1 (AES-128-ECB) which works with most devices. CipherV2 support is implemented but not yet exposed in the UI.

### Q: My device shows as unavailable

**A:** This can happen if:

- The device is offline or not connected to WiFi
- Your internet connection is unstable
- The Gree Cloud servers are experiencing issues
- The device was removed from your Gree+ account

Try power-cycling the device and ensuring it's connected in the Gree+ app.

### Q: Can I control multiple devices?

**A:** Yes! The integration automatically discovers all devices associated with your Gree+ account across all homes.

### Q: Does this support Fahrenheit?

**A:** Yes, the integration detects the temperature unit set on your device and displays temperatures accordingly.
